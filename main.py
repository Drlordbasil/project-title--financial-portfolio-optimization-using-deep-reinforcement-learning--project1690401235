Here are a few optimizations for your Python script:

1. Use relative imports instead of explicit imports of individual modules:
```python
```

2. Use a more efficient method for normalizing the action array:
```python
action = action / np.sum(action)
```

3. Avoid unnecessary re-initializations of `portfolio_weights`:
```python
self.portfolio_weights = action.copy()
```

4. Use the `np.nan_to_num()` function to handle NaN values in returns calculation:
```python
returns = np.nan_to_num((prices / prices.shift(1)) - 1)
```

5. Move the `plt.show()` statement outside the `render()` method for better performance:
```python


def render(self, mode='human '):
    plt.plot(self.history)
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Portfolio Value')


```

These optimizations should help improve the efficiency and performance of your script.
